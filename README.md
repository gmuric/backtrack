# backtrack

# Back-track people with symptoms using geo-location data to identify exposed population

### See the example: https://github.com/gmuric/backtrack/blob/master/backtrack_example.ipynb

* The code gets the **location data** of a population as an input
* It returns: **risky population**, together with a **SCORE** - The score is calculated based on: **number of encounters with infected**, **distance from infected**, **time spent with infected**
